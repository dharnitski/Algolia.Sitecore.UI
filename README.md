# Algolia.Sitecore.UI

This project contains Sitecore visual components for [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com) search engine. 

Algolia team released awesome set if UI widgets [instantsearch.js](https://community.algolia.com/instantsearch.js/) which are used as framework for this project.

I tried to stay as close as possible to original implementation, check [Documentation](https://community.algolia.com/instantsearch.js/documentation/) if you want to know how all that works.
